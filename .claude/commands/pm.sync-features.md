# Sync Features to Docs

Use the Task tool to invoke the product-manager agent to sync implementation changes back to product documentation.

`subagent_type: product-manager`

**Prompt**: "Analyze implementation changes from [file-path] or conversation context. Update related PRDs for functional changes. Spawn product-design-lead for UI/UX changes to design specs."
