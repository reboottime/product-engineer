# Write PRD

Use the Task tool to invoke the product-manager agent to write a Product Requirements Document (PRD).

`subagent_type: product-manager`

**Prompt**: "Write PRD for $ARGUMENTS defining WHAT to build and WHY. Verify validation exists, gather context, and write to `/docs/product/requirements/$ARGUMENTS.md`. Offer to spawn product-design-lead for UX design."
