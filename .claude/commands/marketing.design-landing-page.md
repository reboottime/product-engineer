Design a landing page following Y Combinator's proven methodology.

Use the **landing-page-expert** agent (Task tool, subagent_type: landing-page-expert) to:

1. **Gather Context** - Read product docs, research, requirements
2. **Apply YC Formula** - Structure using 5 essential sections (Hero → Problem → Solution → Social Proof → CTA/FAQ)
3. **Write Complete Copy** - Headlines, body, CTAs for all sections
4. **Score & Validate** - YC checklist (X/7), flag missing data with priorities
5. **Handoff** - Provide design guidance notes for product-design-lead

**Output**: `/docs/product/design/screens/landing.md`

**Framework**: YC 5-Section Formula + Kevin Hale's Pitch Framework

**Reference**: `/docs/marketing/landing-page/yc-landing-strategy.md`
