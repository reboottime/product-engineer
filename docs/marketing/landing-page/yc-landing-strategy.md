# Y Combinator Landing Page Philosophy

> How YC teaches startups to build landing pages from 0 to 1

## Core YC Philosophy

### "Make Something People Want"

The unofficial Y Combinator motto, coined by Paul Graham after his experience "making something people didn't want" for six months.

> "Make something people want" is the destination, but "be relentlessly resourceful" is how you get there.
> — Paul Graham

**Key insight**: Your landing page exists to validate whether people actually want what you're building.

## The YC MVP Mindset

### What is an MVP?

According to Michael Seibel (YC Partner):

> "When you think about an MVP, you should think about something ridiculously simple. This is the first thing you can give to the very first set of users you want to target, in order to see if you can deliver any value at all."

### MVP Landing Page Principles

1. **Build fast** — weeks, not months
2. **Start with a landing page + spreadsheet** if needed
3. **Focus on highest-order problems** — ignore the rest until later
4. **Hold the problem tightly, hold the solution loosely**

### Real Example: Airbnb (2008)

- No payment processing (exchanged money in person)
- No map view
- Built by one person working part-time
- **It was enough to validate the idea**

## The 5 Essential Landing Page Sections

From YC community consensus:

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Hero** | Explain what you do in seconds |
| **Features** | Show how it works |
| **Social Proof** | Build trust |
| **Pricing** | Remove friction |
| **CTA** | Convert visitors |

---

## Section-by-Section YC Guidance

### 1. Hero Section

**Paul Graham's Rule:**
> "The most important is to explain, as concisely as possible, what the hell your site is about."

**Requirements:**

- Explain what you do immediately
- No sliders or carousels (they kill conversions)
- Don't use your company name as headline
- Your customer is the hero, not you

**What to Include:**

- Clear headline stating the benefit
- Subheadline explaining how
- Interactive demo or product video above the fold
- Single, clear CTA

**Time Test**: Visitors should understand your value proposition in under 15 seconds.

### 2. Problem Validation

YC startups use landing pages to validate problems before building full products.

**Techniques:**

- Show the "before and after" impact
- Quantify the problem (time wasted, money lost)
- Use specific, relatable scenarios

**MVP Tool Section:**
Many YC startups include an interactive tool that lets users:

- Import their own data
- See personalized benefits
- Experience the value immediately

This validates interest AND collects analytics on engagement.

### 3. Social Proof

**What Works:**

- Real customer logos with context
- Testimonials with names, photos, job titles
- Specific, quantifiable results
- User counts and adoption metrics

**What Doesn't Work:**

- Generic praise without specifics
- Fake-looking stock photos
- Testimonials without real identities
- Vague claims about "loving" the product

**Investor Credibility:**

- List investor names/logos
- Banner announcing recent funding
- Links to press coverage

### 4. Pricing Section

**YC Best Practices:**

- Transparent pricing (no "contact us")
- Free trial or freemium option
- Highlight most popular tier
- Include premium tier for anchoring

**Risk Reduction:**

- "No credit card required"
- Money-back guarantee
- Free tier to start

### 5. FAQ Section

**Purpose**: Objection handling disguised as information

**Must Answer:**

- "Is this for me?" (targeting)
- "How does it work?" (clarity)
- "What if it doesn't work?" (risk)
- "Is my data safe?" (trust)

**Advanced**: Integrate AI chatbot for detailed questions

## Kevin Hale's Pitch Framework

### The Three Parts of a Startup Idea

A startup idea is a hypothesis for why your company will grow quickly:

1. **Problem** — What pain exists?
2. **Solution** — How do you solve it?
3. **Insight** — Why will this work now?

### What Makes a Great Problem?

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Widespread** | Many people affected |
| **Growing** | Not going away |
| **Urgent** | Needs solution quickly |
| **Expensive** | High cost if unsolved |

### Clarity Rule

> "Lead with what. Not why or how."

Answer three questions clearly:

1. What do you do?
2. What problem do you solve?
3. Who is it for?

**Don't venture further** — the why and how gets in the way of clarity at first.

### Word-of-Mouth Foundation

> "Marketing and advertising is the tax companies pay because they didn't make something remarkable."
> — Kevin Hale

A clear idea is the foundation for organic growth.

## Talk to Users, Not Just Build

### Adora Cheung's Framework

Talking to users helps you with three things:

1. Convert them into customers and revenue
2. Understand if you're on the right track
3. Figure out your product roadmap

> "A very common mistake technical founders make is to build things first, and then go talk to users."

### Landing Page as User Research

Your landing page is a conversation starter, not an end point.

**Practical tip from Adora Cheung:**
> "If people are coming to your website and no one's signing up... just put a phone number on there. People still like to talk to people."

### Questions to Ask Users

- "What is the hardest thing about [problem]?"
- "How often do you experience this?"
- "What have you tried before?"

**Avoid:**

- Yes/no questions
- Asking about features (users give good problems, bad solutions)
- Two questions at once

---

## Critical Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Automatic Carousels/Sliders

- Perceived as ads
- Force visitors to wait
- Reduce conversions significantly
- **Solution**: Display all content simultaneously

### 2. Ego-Centric Design

- Large logos that mean nothing to visitors
- Company name as headline
- "We" language instead of "you"
- **Solution**: Focus on customer benefits

### 3. Unclear Value Propositions

- Buzzwords: "platform", "solution", "leverage"
- Clever wordplay over clarity
- Assuming visitors know your industry
- **Solution**: Pass the "so what?" test

### 4. Generic Visuals

- Stock icons (cogwheels, clouds, lightbulbs)
- Staged stock photography
- Meaningless illustrations
- **Solution**: Show real product, real people

### 5. Premature Polish

> "The goal of a pre-launch startup is to launch something bad quickly and get initial customers."
> — Michael Seibel

Don't perfect things that no one's tested.

## The YC Launch Philosophy

### Launch Early, Launch Often

From Kat Manalac (YC Outreach):

- Launch is not a one-time event
- Launch repeatedly on different channels
- Each launch is a chance to learn

### Order of Operations

1. Talk to potential users
2. Build MVP (landing page + basic function)
3. Launch to small group
4. Gather feedback
5. Iterate
6. Launch again

### Speed Over Perfection

> "Don't overthink—just build a version that's basic but functional and get it into users' hands within two-three months."

---

## Design & Usability Requirements

### Legibility

- Large font sizes (bigger than print)
- Adequate font weight (avoid thin typefaces)
- Narrow columns (45-90 characters per line)
- High contrast
- Left-aligned text only

### CTA Strategy

- Clear hierarchy among CTAs
- Repeat CTAs throughout the page
- Place CTAs after explaining the offering
- Comfort readers before conversion

### Mobile First

YC startups ensure responsive design while maintaining legibility and hierarchy across all screen sizes.

## Validation Metrics

### What to Measure

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| Time on page | Engagement level |
| Scroll depth | Content interest |
| CTA clicks | Intent to convert |
| Sign-up rate | Product-market fit signal |
| Bounce rate | Message clarity |

### A/B Testing Priority

1. Headline (highest impact)
2. CTA text and placement
3. Social proof format
4. Pricing presentation
5. Hero image/video

---

## Summary: The YC Landing Page Formula

```
1. Explain what you do (immediately, clearly)
2. Show the product working (demo/video above fold)
3. Prove others trust you (specific social proof)
4. Remove risk (free trial, guarantee)
5. Make action easy (clear, repeated CTA)
6. Talk to users (phone number, chat, feedback loops)
```
